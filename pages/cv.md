        <td>Be/X-ray Binary Outbursts and Accretion Disks<br />
        Research Advisor: Dr. Rebecca Martin<br />
        I study the outbursts from binary systems consisting of a Be star and a neutron star. I use the PHANTOM Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code, by Daniel Price, to investigate the mass transfer and disk evolution of a Be/X-ray binary system. We consider varying properties of the disc and binary including retrograde motion, inclination, and eccentricity. </td>

        Research Advisor: Dr. Robert Quimby<br />
        I used observations from the Evryscope and the Mount Laguna Observatory All-Sky Camera to extract and analyze the light curve of the nova, V1674 Her. I designed a pipeline to process the Evryscope image data using point spread function fitting. We were interested in the observed plateau in the pre-maximum light curve, and my image processing provided improved photometry of the nova.</td>

        Research Advisor: Dr. Andrew Benson  <br />
        I ran numerical experiments of the Rockstar halo-finder to determine the detection efficiency of dark matter subhalos of various sizes and distances from the center of the host halo. My work improved our understanding of the interworkings and application of the Rockstar halo-finder.</td>

        I worked with Dr. Nollett to model the internal processes of lithium production in asymptotic giant branch stars using the MESA stellar evolution code. Our goals were to use the MESA Stellar Evolution code to test the effect of different strengths of convective overshoot.</td>
