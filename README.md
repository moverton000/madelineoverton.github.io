| <b>Education</b> | <b>University of Nevada, Las Vegas</b> |
| August 2024 - Present | Ph.D Astronomy |
| August 2022 - May 2024 | MS Astronomy<br>GPA: 3.52<br>MS Thesis:<br>Overton, M. (2024). Tilt Instability of a Retrograde Disc Around One Component of a Binary (Order No. 31236889). Available from Dissertations & Theses @ University of Nevada Las Vegas; ProQuest One Academic. (3087051272). |
| | <b>San Diego State University</b> | 
| August 2018 - May 2022 | Bachelor of Science in Astronomy and Minor in Mathematics and Honors Minor in Interdisciplinary Studies<br>GPA: 3.73 |
| <b>Research</b> | |
| August 2022 - Present | Be/X-ray Binary Outbursts and Accretion Disks<br>Research Advisor: Dr. Rebecca Martin<br>I study the outbursts from binary systems consisting of a Be star and a neutron star. I use the PHANTOM Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code, by Daniel Price, to investigate the mass transfer and disk evolution of a Be/X-ray binary system. We consider varying properties of the disc and binary including retrograde motion, inclination, and eccentricity. |
| August 2021 - May 2022 | Undergraduate Senior Thesis<br>Research Advisor: Dr. Robert Quimby<br>I used observations from the Evryscope and the Mount Laguna Observatory All-Sky Camera to extract and analyze the light curve of the nova, V1674 Her. I designed a pipeline to process the Evryscope image data using point spread function fitting. We were interested in the observed plateau in the pre-maximum light curve, and my image processing provided improved photometry of the nova. |
| June 2021 - August 2021 | Carnegie Observatories Summer Student Intern<br>Research Advisor: Dr. Andrew Benson<br>I ran numerical experiments of the Rockstar halo-finder to determine the detection efficiency of dark matter subhalos of various sizes and distances from the center of the host halo. My work improved our understanding of the interworkings and application of the Rockstar halo-finder. |
| May 2020 - May 2021 | Undergraduate Research Assistant<br>Research Advisor: Dr. Kenneth Nollett<br>I worked with Dr. Nollett to model the internal processes of lithium production in asymptotic giant branch stars using the MESA stellar evolution code. Our goals were to use the MESA Stellar Evolution code to test the effect of different strengths of convective overshoot. |

| <b>Student Societies and Organizations | |
| | Astronomy on Tap, Las Vegas<br>September 2022 - Present<br>I have assisted with the organization of events for Astronomy on tap, which seeks to engage the Las Vegas community in astronomy through trivia and science presentations. |
| | SDSU Schwartz Astronomical Society - Club Secretary<br>October 2019 - May 2022<br>Members met every other week for a wide range of purposes including hosting guest speakers, graduate school and programming workshops, and occasionally debates to develop public speaking skills. I organized outreach events including Star Parties and trips to SDSU’s Reginald Buller 0.5-meter visitors’ telescope. |
| | Cal Bridge Scholar, Cohort 7<br>July 2020 - May 2022<br>Cal Bridge promotes broader participation by underrepresented groups in physics and astronomy. As a scholar, I met with faculty mentors from various UC campuses and attended professional development workshops designed to prepare students for life in a PhD program and beyond. As a Cal Bridge alumni, I now participate in mentoring undergraduates. |
| <b>Employment</b> | |
| | UNLV Graduate Teaching Assistant<br>August 2022 - Present<br>I have been a graduate teaching assistant for the introductory astronomy laboratory for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters, and introductory physics laboratories since the Fall semester of 2023. I teach multiple sections of students, present lectures, and set up lab equipment, including telescopes for the relevant courses. |
